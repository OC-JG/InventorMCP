# Changelog

Notable changes, newest first. Dates are when the work landed, not a release.

## Unreleased

### Added
- Every non-sketch operation returns a `measured` block — volume, its change,
  face and edge counts, and the bounding span when it moves — so the model can
  tell that its last step did nothing. Inventor reports success for operations
  that changed nothing at all, and this is how you see it.
- Polyline profiles now carry driving dimensions, so an L-section is revisable.
  Previously they carried constraints only and their parameters drove nothing.
- Dimensions have a soft-failure path: those the planner adds to remove a
  degree of freedom are optional, and Inventor refusing one no longer kills the
  whole sketch. The recipe's own dimensions stay required and go first.
- A sketch plane's axes are measured (`SketchToModelSpace`) rather than assumed,
  so a recipe's `x` means model X on every plane. Any signed permutation is
  handled, which covers offset work planes and axis-aligned faces for free.
- Edge convexity is decided from the boundary loops, which is exact, rather than
  from a sampled point on each face, which a face with a hole in it can fool.
- Every Inventor call runs on one dedicated thread. The API is
  apartment-threaded and `CoInitialize` is per thread, while the MCP SDK runs
  synchronous tools on a pool of workers.
- `skills/inventor-parametric-modelling` — the hard-won knowledge as an Agent
  Skill, where a model reads it, with tests keeping its claims true.
- `scripts/probe_convexity.py`, `scripts/probe_hole.py`,
  `scripts/dump_constants.py` — diagnostics that measure rather than guess.
- `--edit NAME=VALUE` on `scripts/live_smoke.py`: change a parameter, rebuild,
  and report what moved. A parameter that moves nothing is reported as a
  failure, since that is the whole premise.
- CI for the offline half, on Linux and Windows.
- A `LICENSE` file, which `pyproject.toml` had been claiming for a while.

### Fixed
- Holes drilled the wrong way and removed nothing. Inventor's extent enum runs
  opposite to an extrude's for a hole; the side is now chosen from where the
  material is, before the feature is built, because a hole consumes its sketch
  and cannot be rebuilt the other way round.
- A cut or hole that meets no material is no longer reported as a success.
- The expression normaliser dropped brackets under a unary minus, so `-(a + 2)`
  reached Inventor as `-a + 2` — a different number.
- `_magnitude` deleted a leading minus to make a dimension unsigned, which is
  the negation only when that minus governs the whole expression.
- Mirroring an arc left the endpoint references in its constraints pointing at
  the wrong end, which could not fail loudly.
- A refused coincident constraint no longer fails a sketch on the strength of
  its kind; the question is asked of the sketch that came out.
- Standalone sketch points and a circle's centre join the point-sharing scheme,
  removing eleven redundant constraints from a bolt circle.
- Errors are sanitised on the way out, so a COM failure no longer ships an
  absolute path — a user name, a project directory, a network share.
- Disputed enum fallback values refuse rather than guess.

### Known limits
- Revolve, sweep, loft, patterns and threads are written but unproven: no
  shipped recipe reaches them.
- Counterbore, countersink and tapped hole styles are recorded and reported but
  the COM path drills a plain hole.
- Assemblies, drawings and sheet metal are not supported.
- Regular polygons keep one degree of freedom; Inventor refuses the closing
  equal-length constraint.
