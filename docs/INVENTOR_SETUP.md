# Running against a live Inventor

The COM backend needs Windows, a licensed Autodesk Inventor, and `pywin32`.
Everything else in this repository runs anywhere.

```powershell
py -m pip install -e ".[inventor]"
py -m inventor_mcp --backend inventor
```

`--backend inventor` fails loudly if Inventor cannot be reached. `--backend auto`
falls back to the simulator instead, which is convenient day to day but can hide a
broken connection — use `inventor` when you mean it, and check `connect`'s reply:

```json
{"backend": "inventor", "simulated": false, "connected": true, "version": "2025"}
```

## How the connection is made

`connect` tries `GetActiveObject("Inventor.Application")` first, so an already-open
session is reused and you can watch the model appear. If none is running and
`start_if_needed` is true, it falls back to `Dispatch`, which launches Inventor.
Startup takes tens of seconds on a cold machine; the first `connect` may be slow.

The backend then calls `gencache.EnsureDispatch` to generate the early-bound type
library wrapper. That is what makes enum values exact for your installed version.
It is best-effort — see below if it fails.

## Enum constants

Inventor's API takes enum values (`kJoinOperation`, `kVerticalDim`, …) whose numbers
come from its type library.

`inventor_mcp/backend/com/constants.py` resolves each name from the type library
when it is available and from a fallback table when it is not. The fallback table is
a convenience for machines where the pywin32 cache cannot be generated — a read-only
`gen_py` directory, a roaming profile, or a stale cache after an Inventor upgrade.

**If a feature is created with the wrong behaviour** — a cut that joins, a vertical
dimension that comes out aligned — a fallback value is the first suspect. Fix the
type library rather than the table:

```powershell
# Delete the stale generated cache and let it regenerate
Remove-Item -Recurse "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Temp\gen_py"
py -c "import win32com.client; win32com.client.gencache.EnsureDispatch('Inventor.Application')"
```

If regeneration is impossible in your environment, correct the value in `FALLBACK`
for your Inventor version and open an issue with the version number.

## What to check first on a new machine

The recipe layer is covered by tests; the COM calls are not, because they need a
CAD seat. Work through the examples in order — each one exercises a different part
of the API surface:

| Example | Exercises |
|---|---|
| `mounting_plate.json` | Sketch geometry, constraints, dimensions, extrude, fillet by selector, hole from a point grid |
| `hex_standoff.json` | Polygon construction-circle constraints, tapped hole, chamfer on circular edges |
| `flanged_shaft.json` | Offset work plane, stacked extrusions, bolt circle, blind holes |
| `enclosure_base.json` | Shell with a removed face, cut extrude on a second plane |
| `angle_bracket.json` | Polyline profile, symmetric extrude, slot, mirror, sketch on YZ |

Build each one, then in Inventor:

1. Open the parameter table (`fx`). Every dimension should show an **expression**,
   not a number. If dimensions show plain numbers, the expression is not reaching
   `DimensionConstraint.Parameter.Expression`.
2. Check the browser for sketch icons showing an under-constrained state. A
   correctly built sketch from this server should be fully constrained.
3. Change a parameter and rebuild. The part should move coherently. Geometry that
   jumps or flips indicates a missing locating constraint.

## Known-shaky areas

These are the parts of the COM backend most likely to need adjustment, and why:

- **`sweep`** uses `Profiles.AddForSurface` on the first path entity. A multi-segment
  path may need the whole sketch passed instead.
- **`shell`** uses `CreateShellDefinition`. Older releases expose a direct
  `ShellFeatures.Add(faces, thickness, direction)` instead.
- **`thread`** creates a definition from the first selected face only.
- **Hole styles** other than plain drilled (counterbore, countersink, tapped) are
  carried through the recipe and reported, but the COM path currently creates a
  drilled hole. The recipe records the intent, so upgrading this does not change
  any recipe.
- **Face normals** are read via `GetNormalAtParam` with `IsParamReversed` applied.
  If `top`/`bottom` selectors pick the wrong faces, that is where to look.

None of these affect the mock backend or the recipe format.

## Exporting

Export goes through `Document.SaveAs` with a corrected extension, rather than
looking up translator add-in GUIDs, which move between releases. The written file is
then checked on disk; if Inventor reports success but nothing appears, the format's
translator add-in is probably disabled (Tools → Add-Ins).

Formats: `step stl iges sat dwg dxf obj 3mf ipt`.

## Performance

Sketch construction is wrapped in a batch that disables `ScreenUpdating` and defers
`Document.Update()` until the sketch is complete. A large sketch built with redraw on
can take an order of magnitude longer.

Topology handles returned by `select_topology` are regenerated on each call and are
invalid after any rebuild. Do not cache them across operations; re-select instead.

## Security note

Inventor automation runs with the permissions of the logged-in user and can open,
modify and overwrite files. Run the server against a scratch directory when driving
it from an autonomous agent, and be aware that `open_part` and `save_part` take
arbitrary paths.
